# Practice using the Python interpreter as a calculator:

# 1. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 Ï€ r^3. 
# What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5? (Hint: 392.7 is wrong!)
# volume: 392.7

# 2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 
# 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents for 
# each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?
# shipping = 48
# books = 598.80
# total wholesale cost: 646.8

# 3. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace 
# (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy 
# pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?
# 29:51 mins (and seconds) total running
# time:7:21
# That's not much of a run for you!
