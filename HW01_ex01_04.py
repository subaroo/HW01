# Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator. 
# Pythonâ€™s syntax for math operations is almost the same as 
# standard mathematical notation. For example, the symbols 
# +, - and / denote addition, subtraction and division, as you would expect. 
# The symbol for multiplication is *.

# If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your 
# average time per mile? What is your average speed in miles per hour? 
# (Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile).
# Average Speed in MPH:


10/1.61 = 6.211180124223602 miles

43.5 minutes
43.5/60 = .725 hours


Answers:
43.5/6.211 = 7.003 minutes per mile
6.211/0.725 = 8.567 miles per hour
